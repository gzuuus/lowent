# LowEnt

## Be anon, or not, chat freely

### DEMO! WIP

A nostr chat client that uses “low entropy keys” to create rooms or topics. Rooms are identified by the sha256 hash of a string, which serves as a private key for all participants to send messages. Supports anonymous and auth chat, pseudo-anon in progress. Cipher rooms,  encrypted messages using the room's public key. More features to come.
